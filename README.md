In [*Registered Replication Report: Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988)*](papers/Wagenmaker-et-al_2016_APS.pdf) by Wagenmakers *et al.* (2016), the authors conducted a replication study of one of the most popular and heavily cited papers on the association between physical acts and behavior, [*Inhibiting and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback Hypothesis*](papers/Strack_1988_Inhibiting-and-facilitating-conditions-of-the-human-smile-a-nonobtrusive-test-of-the-facial-feedback-hypothesis.pdf).
I was curious about the results, so I conducted my own exploration of the data and statistical analysis.
