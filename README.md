In [*Registered Replication Report: Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988)*](papers/Wagenmaker-et-al_2016_APS.pdf) by Wagenmaker *et al.* (2016), the authors conducted a replication study of one of the most popular and heavily cited papers on the association between physical acts and behavior, [*Inhibiting and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback Hypothesis*](papers/Strack_1988_Inhibiting-and-facilitating-conditions-of-the-human-smile-a-nonobtrusive-test-of-the-facial-feedback-hypothesis.pdf).
I was curious about the results, so I am conducting my own exploration of the data and statistical analysis.

## Important details from the paper

### Procedure

>Participants worked through the tasks in the task booklet while holding the pen in their mouth. The first task was to draw lines between a series of successive numbers and the second task was to underline vowels. The third and crucial task was to rate how amused they were by four cartoons. For each cartoon, participants answered the question “What feeling was elicited in you by looking at the cartoon?” by using a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (I felt not at all amused) to 9 (I felt very much amused).
>
>After these tasks, participants removed the pen from their mouths and completed an exit questionnaire that asked three questions: (a) “How successful were you in holding the pen in the correct position during the entire experimental session?” (the answer was indicated on a 10-point Likert scale, as in SMS Study 2); (b) “Did you understand the cartoons?” (yes/no); and (c) “What do you think the purpose of this experiment is?” (open-ended).

### Exclusion criteria

> Exclusion criteria were deliberately strict. Data were excluded from participants whose average cartoon rating exceeded 2.5 standard deviations from the group mean in their condition. Data were excluded if, based on the exit questionnaire, participants correctly guessed the goal of the study (i.e., the position of the pen influences the funniness ratings for the cartoons). Data were also excluded if a participant answered “No” to the question “Did you understand the cartoons?”. Finally, data were excluded from participants who held the pen incorrectly for two or more of the cartoons (based on the video recordings). If participants held the pen incorrectly for just one cartoon, data from that cartoon rating were excluded from analyses.
