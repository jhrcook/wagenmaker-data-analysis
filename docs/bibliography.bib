  abstract = "We investigated the hypothesis that people's facial activity
              influences their affective responses. Two studies were designed
              to both eliminate methodological problems of earlier experiments
              and clarify theoretical ambiguities. This was achieved by having
              subjects hold a pen in their mouth in ways that either inhibited
              or facilitated the muscles typically associated with smiling
              without requiring subjects to pose in a smiling face. Study 1's
              results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure. Subjects
              reported more intense humor responses when cartoons were
              presented under facilitating conditions than under inhibiting
              conditions that precluded labeling of the facial expression in
              emotion categories. Study 2 served to further validate the
              methodology and to answer additional theoretical questions. The
              results replicated Study 1's findings and also showed that facial
              feedback operates on the affective but not on the cognitive
              component of the humor response. Finally, the results suggested
              that both inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms may have
              contributed to the observed affective responses.",

  abstract = "According to the facial feedback hypothesis, people's affective
              responses can be influenced by their own facial expression (e.g.,
              smiling, pouting), even when their expression did not result from
              their emotional experiences. For example, Strack, Martin, and
              Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of
              cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with
              the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen
              with their teeth (inducing a ``smile''), they rated the cartoons
              as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing
              a ``pout''). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis
              has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication
              Report describes the results of 17 independent direct
              replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which
              followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these
              studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the
              ``smile'' and ``pout'' conditions. The original Strack et al.
              (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a
              10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating
              difference of 0.03 units with a 95\% confidence interval ranging
              from -0.11 to 0.16.",
